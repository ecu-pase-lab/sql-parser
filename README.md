Introduction
------------

This repository contains our ongoing work on parsing SQL queries with dynamic
query fragments.

Installing Our Software
-----------------------

If you have not already, you should start by following the installation instructions given on the [PHP AiR][PAiR] project page.
Next, you should follow the installation instructions on the [QCPAnalysis][QCP] project page.

This repository should then be cloned into the PHPAnalysis directory created during installation of [PHP AiR][PAiR].
Finally, all dependencies must be installed using composer.

Running Our Software
--------------------
The Demos directory of the [QCPAnalysis][QCP] project contains a demo that provides an
example of how this parser works with our other tools. More detailed information
about running our software will be added later.
